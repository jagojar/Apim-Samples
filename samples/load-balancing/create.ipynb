    "# Samples: Load Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets up an APIM instance that demonstrates load balancing and circuit breaking across backends. \n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ **Supported infrastructures**: apim-aca, afd-apim (with ACA)\n",
    "\n",
    "⌚ **Expected *Run All* runtime (excl. infrastructure prerequisite): ~3 minutes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand how backends can be configured to balance load in a prioritized, weighted manner.\n",
    "1. Learn how circuit breakers aid with load balancing.\n",
    "1. Configure how retries in API Management policies can result in more successful requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Components\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab integrates into an existing Azure Container Apps architecture and sets up the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One container app that serves multiple mock Web API endpoints returning 429 error codes. \n",
    "- Three separate backends are set up in APIM that each point to a different endpoint on this container app (e.g. /api/0, /api/1, etc.).\n",
    "- Four separate backend pool with varying load balancer setups are configured using these three backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide which of the [Infrastructure Architectures](../../README.md#infrastructure-architectures) you wish to use.\n",
    "    1. If the infrastructure _does not_ yet exist, navigate to the desired [infrastructure](../../infrastructure/) folder and follow its README.md.\n",
    "    1. If the infrastructure _does_ exist, adjust the `user-defined parameters` in the _Initialize notebook variables_ below. Please ensure that all parameters match your infrastructure."
