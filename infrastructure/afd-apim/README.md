# Front Door & API Management & Container Apps Infrastructure

Secure architecture that takes all traffic off the public Internet once Azure Front Door is traversed. This is due to Front Door's use of a private link to Azure API Management.

Azure Front Door routes traffic to API Management, which then routes to Container Apps. Telemetry is sent to Azure Monitor." title="Azure Front Door, API Management & Container Apps Architecture" width="1000" />

## Objectives

1. Provide a secure pathway to API Management via a private link from Front Door
1. Maintain private networking by integrating API Management with a VNet to communicate with Azure Container Apps. (This can also be achieved via a private link there)
1. Empower users to use Azure Container Apps, if desired
1. Enable observability by sending telemetry to Azure Monitor

## Configuration

Adjust the `user-defined parameters` in this lab's Jupyter Notebook's [Initialize notebook variables](./create.ipynb#initialize-notebook-variables) section.

## Execution

1. Execute this lab's [Jupyter Notebook](./create.ipynb) step-by-step or via _Run All_.
